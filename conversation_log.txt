CONVERSATION LOG - Healthcare Provider App Consent Flow Fix
=======================================================

ISSUE 1: Initial Report
----------------------
USER: Reported issues with consent functionality on privacy page (https://provider-gvgh.onrender.com/privacy)
- Clicking "Accept & Continue" redirects back to privacy page
- Logs disappearing unless "Preserve Log" enabled

ASSISTANT: Acknowledged redirect loop issue and proposed fixes for both server and client side:
Server-side changes (`server.py`):
- Generate unique session ID if none exists
- Log consent processing
- Save to database
- Return JSON response with redirect URL

Client-side changes (`privacy.html`):
- Add event listener for consent checkbox
- Modify submitConsent function
- Handle JSON response
- Improve error handling

ISSUE 2: Implementation
----------------------
USER: Requested to push the changes

ASSISTANT: Implemented changes to:
1. `templates/privacy.html`
2. `server.py`
Including:
- Server-side: Changed redirect to JSON response
- Client-side: Updated fetch headers, JSON handling
- Added detailed logging
- Improved error handling

ISSUE 3: Continued Problems
--------------------------
USER: Reported continuing issues with redirect loop

ASSISTANT: Identified JSON parsing error due to mixed content types.
Proposed simplified solution:
1. Remove JSON handling
2. Use standard form submission
3. Direct redirect response
4. Remove content-type headers
5. Simplify client-side redirect handling

ISSUE 4: Persistent Redirect Loop
-------------------------------

Fixed by:
1. Updating check_consent to allow /accept-consent endpoint

FINAL SOLUTION
-------------
The final fix addressed:
1. Consent check bypass for /accept-consent endpoint
